# Instructor Notes — Recurring Mistakes

The instructor logs recurring mistakes here and revisits them during
quizzes and reviews. Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — module/exercise
**Mistake:** what happened (the misconception, not just the code)
**Correction:** the right mental model
**Status:** open | improving | overcome
```

## 2026-10-30 — 01 / ex03_main_guard
**Mistake:** Put `if __name__ == "__main__": return` *inside* `main()`, thinking the guard belongs to the function.
**Correction:** The guard belongs to the *file*. It wraps the top-level `main()` call so the file only does work when run directly. Functions stay plain and always work when called.
**Status:** improving — checkpoint_01 (2026-10-30) put the guard at file level correctly
